name: biobox
version: v0.4.1
summary: |
  A curated collection of high-quality, standalone bioinformatics components built with [Viash](https://viash.io).
description: |
  `biobox` offers a suite of reliable bioinformatics components, similar to [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) and [snakemake-wrappers/bio](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers/tree/master/bio), but built using the [Viash](https://viash.io) framework.

  This approach emphasizes **reusability**, **reproducibility**, and adherence to **best practices**. Key features of `biobox` components include:

  * **Standalone & Nextflow Ready:** Run components directly via the command line or seamlessly integrate them into Nextflow workflows.
  * **High Quality Standards:**
      * Comprehensive documentation for components and parameters.
      * Full exposure of underlying tool arguments.
      * Containerized (Docker) for dependency management and reproducibility.
      * Unit tested for verified functionality.
