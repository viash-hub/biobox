```bash
docker run --rm quay.io/biocontainers/bedtools:2.31.1--h13024bc_3 bedtools sample -h
```

Tool:    bedtools sample (aka sampleFile)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Take sample of input file(s) using reservoir sampling algorithm.

Usage:   bedtools sample [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf/bam>

WARNING:	The current sample algorithm will hold all requested sample records in memory prior to output.
		The user must ensure that there is adequate memory for this.

Options: 
	-n	The number of records to generate.
		- Default = 1,000,000.
		- (INTEGER)

	-seed	Supply an integer seed for the shuffling.
		- By default, the seed is chosen automatically.
		- (INTEGER)

	-ubam	Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only give records
		that have the same strand. Use '-s forward' or '-s reverse'
		for forward or reverse strand records, respectively.
		- By default, records are reported without respect to strand.

	-header	Print the header from the input file prior to results.

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.
