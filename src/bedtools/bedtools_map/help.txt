```

Tool:    bedtools map (aka mapBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Apply a function to a column from B intervals that overlap A.

Usage:   bedtools map [OPTIONS] -a <bed/gff/vcf> -b <bed/gff/vcf>

Options: 
	-c	Specify columns from the B file to map onto intervals in A.
		Default: 5.
		Multiple columns can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

	-o	Specify the operation that should be applied to -c.
		Valid operations:
		    sum, min, max, absmin, absmax,
		    mean, median, mode, antimode
		    stdev, sstdev
		    collapse (i.e., print a delimited list (duplicates allowed)), 
		    distinct (i.e., print a delimited list (NO duplicates allowed)), 
		    distinct_sort_num (as distinct, sorted numerically, ascending),
		    distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct, sorted numerically, desscending),
		    distinct_only (delimited list of only unique values),
		    count
		    count_distinct (i.e., a count of the unique values in the column), 
		    first (i.e., just the first value in the column), 
		    last (i.e., just the last value in the column), 
		Default: sum
		Multiple operations can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

		If there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be
		applied on that column. Likewise, if there is only one operation, but
		multiple columns, that operation will be applied to all columns.
		Otherwise, the number of columns must match the the number of operations,
		and will be applied in respective order.
		E.g., "-c 5,4,6 -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5,
		the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.
		The order of output columns will match the ordering given in the command.


	-delim	Specify a custom delimiter for the collapse operations.
		- Example: -delim "|"
		- Default: ",".

	-prec	Sets the decimal precision for output (Default: 5)

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

Notes: 
	(1) Both input files must be sorted by chrom, then start.
