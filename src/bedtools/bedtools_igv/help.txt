```bash
docker run --rm quay.io/biocontainers/bedtools:2.31.1--h13024bc_3 bedtools igv -h
```

Tool:    bedtools igv (aka bedToIgv)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Creates a batch script to create IGV images 
         at each interval defined in a BED/GFF/VCF file.

Usage:   bedtools igv [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf>

Options: 
	-path	The full path to which the IGV snapshots should be written.
		(STRING) Default: ./

	-sess	The full path to an existing IGV session file to be 
		loaded prior to taking snapshots.

		(STRING) Default is for no session to be loaded.

	-sort	The type of BAM sorting you would like to apply to each image. 
		Options: base, position, strand, quality, sample, and readGroup
		Default is to apply no sorting at all.

	-clps	Collapse the aligned reads prior to taking a snapshot. 
		Default is to no collapse.

Notes:
