```bash
docker run --rm quay.io/biocontainers/bedtools:2.31.1--h13024bc_3 bedtools bamtofastq -h
```

Tool:    bedtools bamtofastq (aka bamToFastq)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Convert BAM alignments to FASTQ files. 

Usage:   bamToFastq [OPTIONS] -i <BAM> -fq <FQ> 

Options:
	-fq2	FASTQ for second end.  Used if BAM contains paired-end data.
		BAM should be sorted by query name is creating paired FASTQ.

	-tags	Create FASTQ based on the mate info
		in the BAM R2 and Q2 tags.

Tips: 
	If you want to create a single, interleaved FASTQ file 
	for paired-end data, you can just write both to /dev/stdout:

	bedtools bamtofastq -i x.bam -fq /dev/stdout -fq2 /dev/stdout > x.ilv.fq

	Also, the samtools fastq command has more fucntionality and is a useful alternative.
