Tool:    bedtools links (aka linksBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Creates HTML links to an UCSC Genome Browser from a feature file.

Usage:   bedtools links [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf> > out.html

Options: 
	-base	The browser basename.  Default: http://genome.ucsc.edu 
	-org	The organism. Default: human
	-db	The build.  Default: hg18

Example: 
	By default, the links created will point to human (hg18) UCSC browser.

	For example, if the URL of your local mirror for mouse MM9 is called: 
	http://mymirror.myuniversity.edu, then you would use the following:
	-base http://mymirror.myuniversity.edu
	-org mouse
	-db mm9
