  - name: Options
    arguments:
      - name: --strand
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Force strandedness.  That is, only merge features
          that are on the same strand.
          - By default, merging is done without respect to strand.

      - name: --specific_strand
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Force merge for one specific strand only.
          Follow with + or - to force merge from only
          the forward or reverse strand, respectively.
          - By default, merging is done without respect to strand.

      - name: --distance
        type: integer
        description: | 
          Maximum distance between features allowed for features
          to be merged.
          - Def. 0. That is, overlapping & book-ended features are merged.
          - (INTEGER)
          - Note: negative values enforce the number of b.p. required for overlap.

      - name: --columns
        type: integer
        description: | 
          Specify columns from the B file to map onto intervals in A.
          Default: 5.
          Multiple columns can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

      - name: --operation
        type: string
        description: | 
          Specify the operation that should be applied to -c.
          Valid operations:
              sum, min, max, absmin, absmax,
              mean, median, mode, antimode
              stdev, sstdev
              collapse (i.e., print a delimited list (duplicates allowed)), 
              distinct (i.e., print a delimited list (NO duplicates allowed)), 
              distinct_sort_num (as distinct, sorted numerically, ascending),
              distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct, sorted numerically, desscending),
              distinct_only (delimited list of only unique values),
              count
              count_distinct (i.e., a count of the unique values in the column), 
              first (i.e., just the first value in the column), 
              last (i.e., just the last value in the column), 
          Default: sum
          Multiple operations can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

          If there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be
          applied on that column. Likewise, if there is only one operation, but
          multiple columns, that operation will be applied to all columns.
          Otherwise, the number of columns must match the the number of operations,
          and will be applied in respective order.
          E.g., "-c 5,4,6 -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5,
          the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.
          The order of output columns will match the ordering given in the command.
      
      - name: --delimiter
        alternatives: -delim
        type: string
        description: | 
          Specify a custom delimiter for the collapse operations.
          - Example: -delim "|"
          - Default: ",".

      - name: --precision
        alternatives: -prec
        type: integer
        description: | 
          Sets the decimal precision for output (Default: 5).
      
      - name: --bed
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          If using BAM input, write output as BED.

      - name: --header
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Print the header from the A file prior to results.

      - name: --no_buffer
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
          of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
          in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
          noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
          other software tools and scripts that need to process one
          line of bedtools output at a time.

      # - name: --io_buffer
      #   type: boolean_true
      #   description: | 
      #     Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
      #     Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
      #     Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.
