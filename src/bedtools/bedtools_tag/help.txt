```

Tool:    bedtools tag (aka tagBam)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Annotates a BAM file based on overlaps with multiple BED/GFF/VCF files
	 on the intervals in -i.

Usage:   bedtools tag [OPTIONS] -i <BAM> -files FILE1 .. FILEn  -labels LAB1 .. LABn

Options: 
	-s	Require overlaps on the same strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the same
		strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).

	-S	Require overlaps on the opposite strand.  That is, only tag alignments that have the opposite
		strand as a feature in the annotation file(s).

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of the alignment.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-tag	Dictate what the tag should be. Default is YB.
		- STRING (two characters, e.g., YK)

	-names	Use the name field from the annotation files to populate tags.
		By default, the -labels values are used.

	-scores	Use the score field from the annotation files to populate tags.
		By default, the -labels values are used.

	-intervals	Use the full interval (including name, score, and strand) to populate tags.
			Requires the -labels option to identify from which file the interval came.
