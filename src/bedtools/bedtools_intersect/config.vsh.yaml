description: |
  bedtools intersect allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features. 
  Moreover, it allows one to have fine control as to how the intersections are reported. 
  bedtools intersect works with both BED/GFF/VCF and BAM files as input.

          Perform a "left outer join". That is, for each feature in A report each overlap with B. 
          If no overlaps are found, report a NULL feature for B.

        alternatives: -u
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Write the original A entry _if_ no overlap is found. 
          - In other words, just report the fact >=1 hit was found.

      - name: --number_of_overlaps_A

        description: | 
          Only report those entries in A that have _no overlaps_ with B.

      - name: --uncompressed_bam
        alternatives: -ubam
        type: boolean_true
        description: Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.

      - name: --same_strand
        alternatives: -s
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B.
          that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
          - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

      - name: --opposite_strand
        alternatives: -S
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
          that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
          - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

      - name: --min_overlap_A
        alternatives: -f
        type: double
        description: | 
          Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
          - Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
          - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
        example: 0.50

      - name: --min_overlap_B
        alternatives: -F
        type: double
        description: | 
          Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
          - Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
          - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
        example: 0.50

      - name: --reciprocal_overlap
        alternatives: -r
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
          - In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
          that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.
      
      - name: --either_overlap
        alternatives: -e
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
          - In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
          that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of B is covered.
          Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

      - name: --split
        type: boolean_true
        description: Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

      - name: --genome
        alternatives: -g
        type: file
        description: | 
          Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome 
          sort order across input files. Only applies when used 
          with -sorted option.
        example: genome.txt

      - name: --nonamecheck
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file 
          has different naming conventions for the same chromosome 
          (e.g., "chr1" vs "chr01").

      - name: --sorted
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Use the "chromsweep" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.

      - name: --names
        type: string
        description: | 
          When using multiple databases, provide an alias 
          for each that will appear instead of a fileId when 
          also printing the DB record.

      - name: --filenames
        type: boolean_true
        description: When using multiple databases, show each complete filename instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

      - name: --sortout
        type: boolean_true
        description: When using multiple databases, sort the output DB hits for each record.

      - name: --bed

      - name: --header
        type: boolean_true
        description: Print the header from the A file prior to results.

      - name: --no_buffer_output
        alternatives: --nobuf
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
          of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
          in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
          noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
          other software tools and scripts that need to process one
          line of bedtools output at a time.

      - name: --io_buffer_size
        alternatives: --iobuf
        type: integer
        description: | 
          Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
          Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
          Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.
