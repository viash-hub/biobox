# Notes:
# - falco as arguments similar to -subsample and we update those to --subsample
# - The outdir argument is not required
# - The input argument in falco is positional but we changed this to --input

      - name: --nogroup
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          Disable grouping of bases for reads >50bp. 
          All reports will show data for every base in 
          the read. WARNING: When using this option, 
          your plots may end up a ridiculous size. You 
          have been warned!
      - name: --contaminents
        type: file
        description: |
          Specifies a non-default file which contains 
          the list of contaminants to screen 
          overrepresented sequences against. The file 
          must contain sets of named contaminants in 
          the form name[tab]sequence. Lines prefixed 
          with a hash will be ignored. Default: 
          https://github.com/smithlabcode/falco/blob/v1.2.5/Configuration/contaminant_list.txt
      - name: --adapters
        type: file
        description: |
          Specifies a non-default file which contains 
          the list of adapter sequences which will be 
          explicity searched against the library. The 
          file must contain sets of named adapters in 
          the form name[tab]sequence. Lines prefixed 
          with a hash will be ignored. Default:
          https://github.com/smithlabcode/falco/blob/v1.2.5/Configuration/adapter_list.txt
      - name: --limits
        type: file
        description: |
          Specifies a non-default file which contains 
          a set of criteria which will be used to 
          determine the warn/error limits for the 
          various modules. This file can also be used 
          to selectively remove some modules from the 
          output all together. The format needs to 
          mirror the default limits.txt file found in 
          the Configuration folder. Default: 
          https://github.com/smithlabcode/falco/blob/v1.2.5/Configuration/limits.txt
      - name: --subsample
        alternatives: [-s]

        example: 10
        description: |
          [Falco only] makes falco faster (but 
          possibly less accurate) by only processing 
          reads that are a multiple of this value (using 
          0-based indexing to number reads).
      - name: --bisulfite
        alternatives: [-b]
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          [Falco only] reads are whole genome 
          bisulfite sequencing, and more Ts and fewer 
          Cs are therefore expected and will be 
          accounted for in base content.
      - name: --reverse_complement
        alternatives: [-r]
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          [Falco only] The input is a 
          reverse-complement. All modules will be 
          tested by swapping A/T and C/G

      - name: --allow_empty_input
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          Allow empty input files and generate empty output files without an error state.

        description: |
          Create all output files in the specified 
          output directory. FALCO-SPECIFIC: If the 
          directory does not exists, the program will 
          create it.

        description: |
          Bypasses the normal sequence file format 
          detection and forces the program to use the 
          specified format. Validformats are bam, sam, 
          bam_mapped, sam_mapped, fastq, fq, fastq.gz 
          or fq.gz.

          file's directory or the one specified in the

          [Falco only] Specify filename for the short 
          summary output (TXT). If not specified, it 
          will be called fastq_report.html in either 
          the input file's directory or the one 
          specified in the --output flag. Only
