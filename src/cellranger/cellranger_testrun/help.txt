```

Execute the 'count' pipeline on a small test dataset

Usage: cellranger testrun [OPTIONS] --id <ID>

Options:
      --id <ID>             A unique run id and output folder name
                            [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+
      --description <TEXT>  Sample description to embed in output files
      --dry                 Do not execute the pipeline. Generate a pipeline
                            invocation (.mro) file and stop
      --jobmode <MODE>      Job manager to use. Valid options: local (default),
                            sge, lsf, slurm or path to a .template file. Search
                            for help on "Cluster Mode" at

                            configuring the pipeline to use a compute cluster
      --localcores <NUM>    Set max cores the pipeline may request at one time.
                            Only applies to local jobs
      --localmem <NUM>      Set max GB the pipeline may request at one time.
                            Only applies to local jobs
      --localvmem <NUM>     Set max virtual address space in GB for the
                            pipeline. Only applies to local jobs
      --mempercore <NUM>    Reserve enough threads for each job to ensure enough
                            memory will be available, assuming each core on your
                            cluster has at least this much memory available.
                            Only applies to cluster jobmodes
      --maxjobs <NUM>       Set max jobs submitted to cluster at one time. Only
                            applies to cluster jobmodes
      --jobinterval <NUM>   Set delay between submitting jobs to cluster, in ms.
                            Only applies to cluster jobmodes
      --overrides <PATH>    The path to a JSON file that specifies stage-level
                            overrides for cores and memory. Finer-grained than
                            --localcores, --mempercore and --localmem. Consult
                            https://10xgen.com/resource-override for an example
                            override file
      --output-dir <PATH>   Output the results to this directory
      --uiport <PORT>       Serve web UI at http://localhost:PORT
      --disable-ui          Do not serve the web UI
      --noexit              Keep web UI running after pipestance completes or
                            fails
      --nopreflight         Skip preflight checks
  -h, --help                Print help
