Prepare a reference for use with CellRanger VDJ

Usage: cellranger mkvdjref [OPTIONS] --genome <GENOME_NAME>

Options:
      --genome <GENOME_NAME>
          Unique genome name, used to name output folder [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+
      --fasta <FASTA_FILE>
          Path to FASTA file containing your genome reference
      --genes <GTF_FILES>
          Path to genes GTF file containing annotated genes for your genome
          reference. Specify multiple genomes by specifying this argument
          multiple times
      --seqs <SEQ_FILE>
          Path to a FASTA file that directly specifies V(D)J sequences. This is
          mutually exclusive with the "fasta" and "genes" args
      --rm-transcripts <REMOVE_TRANSCRIPTS_FILE>
          Path to text file with transcript IDs to ignore. This file should have
          one transcript ID per line where the IDs correspond to the
          "transcript_id" key in the GTF info column
      --memgb <MEM_GB>
          Maximum memory (GB) used [default: 16]
      --ref-version <REF_VERSION>
          Optional reference version string to include with reference
      --dry
          Do not execute the pipeline. Generate a pipeline invocation (.mro)
          file and stop
      --jobmode <MODE>
          Job manager to use. Valid options: local (default), sge, lsf, slurm or
          path to a .template file. Search for help on "Cluster Mode" at
          support.10xgenomics.com for more details on configuring the pipeline
          to use a compute cluster
      --localcores <NUM>
          Set max cores the pipeline may request at one time. Only applies to
          local jobs
      --localmem <NUM>
          Set max GB the pipeline may request at one time. Only applies to local
          jobs
      --localvmem <NUM>
          Set max virtual address space in GB for the pipeline. Only applies to
          local jobs
      --mempercore <NUM>
          Reserve enough threads for each job to ensure enough memory will be
          available, assuming each core on your cluster has at least this much
          memory available. Only applies to cluster jobmodes
      --maxjobs <NUM>
          Set max jobs submitted to cluster at one time. Only applies to cluster
          jobmodes
      --jobinterval <NUM>
          Set delay between submitting jobs to cluster, in ms. Only applies to
          cluster jobmodes
      --overrides <PATH>
          The path to a JSON file that specifies stage-level overrides for cores
          and memory. Finer-grained than --localcores, --mempercore and
          --localmem. Consult https://10xgen.com/resource-override for an
          example override file
      --output-dir <PATH>
          Output the results to this directory
      --uiport <PORT>
          Serve web UI at http://localhost:PORT
      --disable-ui
          Do not serve the web UI
      --noexit
          Keep web UI running after pipestance completes or fails
      --nopreflight
          Skip preflight checks
  -h, --help
          Print help (see more with '--help')
