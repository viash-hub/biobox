About:   Concatenate or combine VCF/BCF files. All source files must have the same sample
         columns appearing in the same order. The program can be used, for example, to
         concatenate chromosome VCFs into one VCF, or combine a SNP VCF and an indel
         VCF into one. The input files must be sorted by chr and position. The files
         must be given in the correct order to produce sorted VCF on output unless
         the -a, --allow-overlaps option is specified. With the --naive option, the files
         are concatenated without being recompressed, which is very fast.
Usage:   bcftools concat [options] <A.vcf.gz> [<B.vcf.gz> [...]]

Options:
   -a, --allow-overlaps           First coordinate of the next file can precede last record of the current file.
   -c, --compact-PS               Do not output PS tag at each site, only at the start of a new phase set block.
   -d, --rm-dups STRING           Output duplicate records present in multiple files only once: <snps|indels|both|all|exact>
   -D, --remove-duplicates        Alias for -d exact
   -f, --file-list FILE           Read the list of files from a file.
   -G, --drop-genotypes           Drop individual genotype information.
   -l, --ligate                   Ligate phased VCFs by matching phase at overlapping haplotypes
       --ligate-force             Ligate even non-overlapping chunks, keep all sites
       --ligate-warn              Drop sites in imperfect overlaps
       --no-version               Do not append version and command line to the header
   -n, --naive                    Concatenate files without recompression, a header check compatibility is performed
       --naive-force              Same as --naive, but header compatibility is not checked. Dangerous, use with caution.
   -o, --output FILE              Write output to a file [standard output]
   -O, --output-type u|b|v|z[0-9] u/b: un/compressed BCF, v/z: un/compressed VCF, 0-9: compression level [v]
   -q, --min-PQ INT               Break phase set if phasing quality is lower than <int> [30]
   -r, --regions REGION           Restrict to comma-separated list of regions
   -R, --regions-file FILE        Restrict to regions listed in a file
       --regions-overlap 0|1|2    Include if POS in the region (0), record overlaps (1), variant overlaps (2) [1]
       --threads INT              Use multithreading with <int> worker threads [0]
   -v, --verbosity INT            Set verbosity level
   -W, --write-index[=FMT]        Automatically index the output files [off]
