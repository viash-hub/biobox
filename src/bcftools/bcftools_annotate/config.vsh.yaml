        description: | 
          When multiple regions overlap a single record, this option defines how to treat multiple annotation values.
          See man page for more details.

      - name: --min_overlap
        type: string
        description: | 
          Minimum overlap required as a fraction of the variant in the annotation -a file (ANN), 
          in the target VCF file (:VCF), or both for reciprocal overlap (ANN:VCF). 
          By default overlaps of arbitrary length are sufficient. 
          The option can be used only with the tab-delimited annotation -a file and with BEG and END columns present.

      - name: --no_version
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Do not append version and command line information to the output VCF header.

      - name: --output_type
        alternatives: --O
        type: string
        choices: ['u', 'z', 'b', 'v']
        description: | 
          Output type:
            u: uncompressed BCF
            z: compressed VCF

      - name: --pair_logic
        type: string
        choices: ['snps', 'indels', 'both', 'all', 'some', 'exact']
        description: | 
          Controls how to match records from the annotation file to the target VCF. 
          Effective only when -a is a VCF or BCF file. 
          The option replaces the former uninuitive --collapse. 
          See Common Options for more.
      
      - name: --regions
        alternatives: --r
        type: string
        description: | 
          Restrict to comma-separated list of regions. 
          Following formats are supported: chr|chr:pos|chr:beg-end|chr:beg-[,…​].
        example: '20:1000000-2000000'

      - name: --regions_file
        alternatives: --R
        type: file
        description: | 
          Restrict to regions listed in a file. 
          Regions can be specified either on a VCF, BED, or tab-delimited file (the default). 
          For more information check manual.

      - name: --regions_overlap
        type: string
        choices: ['pos', 'record', 'variant', '0', '1', '2']
        description: | 
          This option controls how overlapping records are determined: 
          set to 'pos' or '0' if the VCF record has to have POS inside a region (this corresponds to the default behavior of -t/-T); 
          set to 'record' or '1' if also overlapping records with POS outside a region should be included (this is the default behavior of -r/-R, 
          and includes indels with POS at the end of a region, which are technically outside the region); 
          or set to 'variant' or '2' to include only true overlapping variation (compare the full VCF representation "TA>T-" vs the true sequence variation "A>-").

      - name: --rename_annotations 
        type: file
        description: | 
          Rename annotations: TYPE/old\tnew, where TYPE is one of FILTER,INFO,FORMAT.

      - name: --rename_chromosomes
        type: file
        description: | 
          Rename chromosomes according to the map in file, with "old_name new_name\n" pairs 
          separated by whitespaces, each on a separate line.

      - name: --samples
        type: string
        description: | 
          Subset of samples to annotate.
          See also https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#common_options.

      - name: --samples_file
        type: file
        description: | 
          Subset of samples to annotate in file format.
          See also https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#common_options.

      - name: --single_overlaps
        type: boolean_true
        description: | 
          Use this option to keep memory requirements low with very large annotation files. 
          Note, however, that this comes at a cost, only single overlapping intervals are considered in this mode. 
          This was the default mode until the commit af6f0c9 (Feb 24 2019).

      - name: --remove
        alternatives: --x
        type: string
        description: | 
          List of annotations to remove. 
          Use "FILTER" to remove all filters or "FILTER/SomeFilter" to remove a specific filter. 
          Similarly, "INFO" can be used to remove all INFO tags and "FORMAT" to remove all FORMAT tags except GT. 
          To remove all INFO tags except "FOO" and "BAR", use "^INFO/FOO,INFO/BAR" (and similarly for FORMAT and FILTER). 
          "INFO" can be abbreviated to "INF" and "FORMAT" to "FMT".

      - name: --verbosity
        alternatives: -v
        type: integer
        description: | 
          Verbosity level.
