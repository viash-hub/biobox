```
docker run --rm quay.io/biocontainers/bwa:0.7.17--h5bf99c6_8 bwa sampe
```

Usage:   bwa sampe [options] <prefix> <in1.sai> <in2.sai> <in1.fq> <in2.fq>

Options: -a INT   maximum insert size [500]
         -o INT   maximum occurrences for one end [100000]
         -n INT   maximum hits to output for paired reads [3]
         -N INT   maximum hits to output for discordant pairs [10]
         -c FLOAT prior of chimeric rate (lower bound) [1.0e-05]
         -f FILE  sam file to output results to [stdout]
         -r STR   read group header line such as `@RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar' [null]
         -P       preload index into memory (for base-space reads only)
         -s       disable Smith-Waterman for the unmapped mate
         -A       disable insert size estimate (force -s)

Arguments:
         <prefix>   BWA index base name (prefix of .amb, .ann, .bwt, .pac, .sa files)
         <in1.sai>  input SAI file for first reads (R1) generated by BWA aln
         <in2.sai>  input SAI file for second reads (R2) generated by BWA aln
         <in1.fq>   input FASTQ file with first reads in pair (R1)
         <in2.fq>   input FASTQ file with second reads in pair (R2)

Notes: 1. For SOLiD reads, <in1.fq> corresponds R3 reads and <in2.fq> to F3.
       2. For reads shorter than 30bp, applying a smaller -o is recommended to
          to get a sensible speed at the cost of pairing accuracy.
       3. BWA sampe generates SAM format alignments for paired-end reads
       4. Input SAI files must be generated first using BWA aln for each read file
       5. Part of the classic BWA pipeline: bwa index -> bwa aln (x2) -> bwa sampe
