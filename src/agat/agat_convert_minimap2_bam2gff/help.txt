Name:
    agat_convert_minimap2_bam2gff.pl

Description:
    The script converts output from minimap2 (bam or sam) into gff file. To
    get bam from minimap2 use the following command: minimap2 -ax splice:hq
    genome.fa Asecodes_parviclava.nucest.fa | samtools sort -O BAM -o
    output.bam To use bam with this script you will need samtools in your
    path.

Usage:
        agat_convert_minimap2_bam2gff.pl -i infile.bam [ -o outfile ]
        agat_convert_minimap2_bam2gff.pl -i infile.sam [ -o outfile ]
        agat_convert_minimap2_bam2gff.pl --help

Options:
    if ( !GetOptions( 'i|input=s' => \$opt_in,

    -i or --input
            Input file in sam (.sam extension) or bam (.bam extension)
            format.

    -b or --bam
            To force to use the input file as sam file.

    -s or --sam
            To force to use the input file as sam file.

    -o, --out or --output
            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified, the output will
            be written to STDOUT.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
