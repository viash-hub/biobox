Name:
    agat_sq_stat_basic.pl

Description:
    The script aims to provide basic statistics of a gtf/gff file.

Usage:
        agat_sq_stat_basic.pl -i <input file> [-g <integer or fasta> -o <output file>]
        agat_sq_stat_basic.pl --help

Options:
    -i, --gff, --file or --input
            STRING: Input GTF/GFF file. Several files can be processed at
            once: -i file1 -i file2

    -g, --genome
            That input is design to know the genome size in order to
            calculate the percentage of the genome represented by each kind
            of feature type. You can provide an INTEGER or the genome in
            fasta format. If you provide the fasta, the genome size will be
            calculated on the fly.

    --inflate
            Inflate the statistics taking into account feature with
            multi-parents. Indeed to avoid redundant information, some gff
            factorize identical features. e.g: one exon used in two
            different isoform will be defined only once, and will have
            multiple parent. By default the script count such feature only
            once. Using the inflate option allows to count the feature and
            its size as many time there are parents.

    -o or --output
            STRING: Output file. If no output file is specified, the output
            will be written to STDOUT. The result is in tabulate format.

    -c or --config
            String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input
            agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
            otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with
            AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config
            --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use
            your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named
            differently).
