NAME
    rsem-prepare-reference - Prepare transcript references for RSEM and
    optionally build BOWTIE/BOWTIE2/STAR/HISAT2(transcriptome) indices.

SYNOPSIS
     rsem-prepare-reference [options] reference_fasta_file(s) reference_name

ARGUMENTS
    reference_fasta_file(s)
        Either a comma-separated list of Multi-FASTA formatted files OR a
        directory name. If a directory name is specified, RSEM will read all
        files with suffix ".fa" or ".fasta" in this directory. The files
        should contain either the sequences of transcripts or an entire
        genome, depending on whether the `--gtf` option is used.

    reference_name
        The name of the reference used. RSEM will generate several
        reference-related files that are prefixed by this name. This name
        can contain path information (e.g. `/ref/mm9`).

OPTIONS
    --gtf <file>
        If this option is on, RSEM assumes that `reference_fasta_file(s)`
        contains the sequence of a genome, and will extract transcript
        reference sequences using the gene annotations specified in <file>,
        which should be in GTF format.

        If this and `--gff3` options are off, RSEM will assume
        `reference_fasta_file(s)` contains the reference transcripts. In
        this case, RSEM assumes that name of each sequence in the
        Multi-FASTA files is its transcript_id.

        (Default: off)

    --gff3 <file>
        The annotation file is in GFF3 format instead of GTF format. RSEM
        will first convert it to GTF format with the file name
        `reference_name.gtf`. Please make sure that `reference_name.gtf`
        does not exist. (Default: off)

    --gff3-RNA-patterns <pattern>
        <pattern> is a comma-separated list of transcript categories, e.g.
        "mRNA,rRNA". Only transcripts that match the <pattern> will be
        extracted. (Default: "mRNA")

    --gff3-genes-as-transcripts
        This option is designed for untypical organisms, such as viruses,
        whose GFF3 files only contain genes. RSEM will assume each gene as a
        unique transcript when it converts the GFF3 file into GTF format.

    --trusted-sources <sources>
        <sources> is a comma-separated list of trusted sources, e.g.
        "ENSEMBL,HAVANA". Only transcripts coming from these sources will be
        extracted. If this option is off, all sources are accepted.
        (Default: off)

    --transcript-to-gene-map <file>
        Use information from <file> to map from transcript (isoform) ids to
        gene ids. Each line of <file> should be of the form:

        `gene_id transcript_id`

        with the two fields separated by a tab character.

        If you are using a GTF file for the "UCSC Genes" gene set from the
        UCSC Genome Browser, then the "knownIsoforms.txt" file (obtained
        from the "Downloads" section of the UCSC Genome Browser site) is of
        this format.

        If this option is off, then the mapping of isoforms to genes depends
        on whether the `--gtf` option is specified. If `--gtf` is specified,
        then RSEM uses the "gene_id" and "transcript_id" attributes in the
        GTF file. Otherwise, RSEM assumes that each sequence in the
        reference sequence files is a separate gene.

        (Default: off)

    --allele-to-gene-map <file>
        Use information from <file> to provide gene_id and transcript_id
        information for each allele-specific transcript. Each line of <file>
        should be of the form:

        gene_id transcript_id allele_id

        with the fields separated by a tab character.

        This option is designed for quantifying allele-specific expression.
        It is only valid if `--gtf` option is not specified. allele_id
        should be the sequence names presented in the Multi-FASTA-formatted
        files.

        (Default: off)

    --polyA
        Add poly(A) tails to the end of all reference isoforms. The length
        of poly(A) tail added is specified by `--polyA-length` option. STAR
        aligner users may not want to use this option. (Default: do not add
        poly(A) tail to any of the isoforms)

    --polyA-length <int>
        The length of the poly(A) tails to be added. (Default: 125)

    --no-polyA-subset <file>
        Only meaningful if `--polyA` is specified. Do not add poly(A) tails
        to those transcripts listed in <file>. <file> is a file containing a
        list of transcript_ids. (Default: off)

    --bowtie
        Build Bowtie indices. (Default: off)

    --bowtie-path <path>
        The path to the Bowtie executables. (Default: the path to Bowtie
        executables is assumed to be in the user`s PATH environment
        variable)

    --bowtie2
        Build Bowtie 2 indices. (Default: off)

    --bowtie2-path <path>
        The path to the Bowtie 2 executables. (Default: the path to Bowtie 2
        executables is assumed to be in the user`s PATH environment
        variable)

    --star
        Build STAR indices. (Default: off)

    --star-path <path>
        The path to STAR`s executable. (Default: the path to STAR executable
        is assumed to be in user`s PATH environment variable)

    --star-sjdboverhang <int>
        Length of the genomic sequence around annotated junction. It is only
        used for STAR to build splice junctions database and not needed for
        Bowtie or Bowtie2. It will be passed as the --sjdbOverhang option to
        STAR. According to STAR`s manual, its ideal value is
        max(ReadLength)-1, e.g. for 2x101 paired-end reads, the ideal value
        is 101-1=100. In most cases, the default value of 100 will work as
        well as the ideal value. (Default: 100)

    --hisat2-hca
        Build HISAT2 indices on the transcriptome according to Human Cell
        Atlas (HCA) SMART-Seq2 pipeline. (Default: off)

    --hisat2-path <path>
        The path to the HISAT2 executables. (Default: the path to HISAT2
        executables is assumed to be in the user`s PATH environment
        variable)

    -p/--num-threads <int>
        Number of threads to use for building STAR`s genome indices.
        (Default: 1)

    -q/--quiet
        Suppress the output of logging information. (Default: off)

    -h/--help
        Show help information.

PRIOR-ENHANCED RSEM OPTIONS
    --prep-pRSEM
        A Boolean indicating whether to prepare reference files for pRSEM,
        including building Bowtie indices for a genome and selecting
        training set isoforms. The index files will be used for aligning
        ChIP-seq reads in prior-enhanced RSEM and the training set isoforms
        will be used for learning prior. A path to Bowtie executables and a
        mappability file in bigWig format are required when this option is
        on. Currently, Bowtie2 is not supported for prior-enhanced RSEM.
        (Default: off)

    --mappability-bigwig-file <string>
        Full path to a whole-genome mappability file in bigWig format. This
        file is required for running prior-enhanced RSEM. It is used for
        selecting a training set of isoforms for prior-learning. This file
        can be either downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser or generated by
        GEM (Derrien et al., 2012, PLoS One). (Default: "")

DESCRIPTION
    This program extracts/preprocesses the reference sequences for RSEM and
    prior-enhanced RSEM. It can optionally build Bowtie indices (with
    `--bowtie` option) and/or Bowtie 2 indices (with `--bowtie2` option)
    using their default parameters. It can also optionally build STAR
    indices (with `--star` option) using parameters from ENCODE3`s STAR-RSEM
    pipeline. For prior-enhanced RSEM, it can build Bowtie genomic indices
    and select training set isoforms (with options `--prep-pRSEM` and
    `--mappability-bigwig-file <string>`). If an alternative aligner is to
    be used, indices for that particular aligner can be built from either
    `reference_name.idx.fa` or `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa` (see OUTPUT for
    details). This program is used in conjunction with the
    `rsem-calculate-expression` program.

OUTPUT
    This program will generate `reference_name.grp`, `reference_name.ti`,
    `reference_name.transcripts.fa`, `reference_name.seq`,
    `reference_name.chrlist` (if `--gtf` is on), `reference_name.idx.fa`,
    `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa`, optional Bowtie/Bowtie 2 index files, and
    optional STAR index files.

    `reference_name.grp`, `reference_name.ti`, `reference_name.seq`, and
    `reference_name.chrlist` are used by RSEM internally.

    `reference_name.transcripts.fa` contains the extracted reference
    transcripts in Multi-FASTA format. Poly(A) tails are not added and it
    may contain lower case bases in its sequences if the corresponding
    genomic regions are soft-masked.

    `reference_name.idx.fa` and `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa` are used by
    aligners to build their own indices. In these two files, all sequence
    bases are converted into upper case. In addition, poly(A) tails are
    added if `--polyA` option is set. The only difference between
    `reference_name.idx.fa` and `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa` is that
    `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa` in addition converts all `N` characters to
    `G` characters. This conversion is in particular desired for aligners
    (e.g. Bowtie) that do not allow reads to overlap with `N` characters in
    the reference sequences. Otherwise, `reference_name.idx.fa` should be
    used to build the aligner`s index files. RSEM uses
    `reference_name.idx.fa` to build Bowtie 2 indices and
    `reference_name.n2g.idx.fa` to build Bowtie indices. For visualizing the
    transcript-coordinate-based BAM files generated by RSEM in IGV,
    `reference_name.idx.fa` should be imported as a "genome" (see
    Visualization section in README.md for details).

    If the whole genome is indexed for prior-enhanced RSEM, all the index
    files will be generated with prefix as `reference_name_prsem`. Selected
    isoforms for training set are listed in the file
    `reference_name_prsem.training_tr_crd`

EXAMPLES
    1)  Suppose we have mouse RNA-Seq data and want to use the UCSC mm9
        version of the mouse genome. We have downloaded the UCSC Genes
        transcript annotations in GTF format (as mm9.gtf) using the Table
        Browser and the knownIsoforms.txt file for mm9 from the UCSC Downloads.
        We also have all chromosome files for mm9 in the directory `/data/mm9`.
        We want to put the generated reference files under `/ref` with name
        `mouse_0`. We do not add any poly(A) tails. Please note that GTF files
        generated from UCSC`s Table Browser do not contain isoform-gene
        relationship information. For the UCSC Genes annotation, this
        information can be obtained from the knownIsoforms.txt file. Suppose we
        want to build Bowtie indices and Bowtie executables are found in
        `/sw/bowtie`.
        
        There are two ways to write the command:

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt 
                            --bowtie
                            --bowtie-path /sw/bowtie         
                            /data/mm9/chr1.fa,/data/mm9/chr2.fa,...,/data/mm9/chrM.fa 
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    OR

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --bowtie
                            --bowtie-path /sw/bowtie
                            /data/mm9
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    2)  Suppose we also want to build Bowtie 2 indices in the above example
        and Bowtie 2 executables are found in `/sw/bowtie2`, the command will
        be:

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --bowtie
                            --bowtie-path /sw/bowtie
                            --bowtie2
                            --bowtie2-path /sw/bowtie2
                            /data/mm9
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    3) Suppose we want to build STAR indices in the above example and save
    index files under `/ref` with name `mouse_0`. Assuming STAR executable
    is `/sw/STAR`, the command will be:

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --star
                            --star-path /sw/STAR
                            -p 8
                            /data/mm9/chr1.fa,/data/mm9/chr2.fa,...,/data/mm9/chrM.fa
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    OR

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --star
                            --star-path /sw/STAR
                            -p 8
                            /data/mm9
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    STAR genome index files will be saved under `/ref/`.

    4)  Suppose we want to prepare references for prior-enhanced RSEM in the
        above example. In this scenario, both STAR and Bowtie are required to
        build genomic indices - STAR for RNA-seq reads and Bowtie for ChIP-seq
        reads. Assuming their executables are under `/sw/STAR` and `/sw/Bowtie`,
        respectively. Also, assuming the mappability file for mouse genome is
        `/data/mm9.bigWig`. The command will be:

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --star
                            --star-path /sw/STAR
                            -p 8
                            --prep-pRSEM
                            --bowtie-path /sw/Bowtie
                            --mappability-bigwig-file /data/mm9.bigWig
                            /data/mm9/chr1.fa,/data/mm9/chr2.fa,...,/data/mm9/chrM.fa 
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    OR

    `rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.gtf
                            --transcript-to-gene-map knownIsoforms.txt
                            --star
                            --star-path /sw/STAR
                            -p 8
                            --prep-pRSEM
                            --bowtie-path /sw/Bowtie
                            --mappability-bigwig-file /data/mm9.bigWig
                            /data/mm9
                            /ref/mouse_0`

    Both STAR and Bowtie`s index files will be saved under `/ref/`. Bowtie
    files will have name prefix `mouse_0_prsem`

    5)  Suppose we only have transcripts from EST tags stored in `mm9.fasta`
        and isoform-gene information stored in `mapping.txt`. We want to add
        125bp long poly(A) tails to all transcripts. The reference_name is set
        as `mouse_125`. In addition, we do not want to build Bowtie/Bowtie 2
        indices, and will use an alternative aligner to align reads against
        either `mouse_125.idx.fa` or `mouse_125.idx.n2g.fa`:

    `rsem-prepare-reference --transcript-to-gene-map mapping.txt
                            --polyA
                            mm9.fasta
                            mouse_125`
